# Compton Scattering (TL M2 NPAC)
## Introduction

This repository contains the files needed to analyze the data of the compton experimental project carried out as part of the M2 NPAC master programme. The analysis aims to determine experimentally the angular diffrential cross section of 511 keV gamma photons undergoing compton scattring processes. The gamma photos originate from the pair annhilation process occuring due to the positive beta decay in Na-22 nuclues producing a positron which then annhilates with electrons in matter giving us the distictive 511 keV gamma photons in the spectrum of Na-22. The results of this analysis is reported in detail in the article attached to this repository.

In order to read the data files which are written in the .fast format, you will need to set up Faster AC framework (faster.in2p3.fr) which is based on the cpp language. However, you may as well use the included pyfaster library to read the data files using python. The nalysis mainly uses ROOT framework with some assistance of other python tools.
